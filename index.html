                <strong>1828</strong>
                - Decides, at the age of 12, that she wants to fly and starts constructing wings by studying birds and their proportions. She even illustrated a guide called “Flyology”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1833</strong>
                - She meets the mathematician, philosopher and inventor Charles Babbage. They become friends and throught her life they had a correspondence concerning Babbage's prototypes "The difference engine" and "The analytical machine".
              </li>

                <strong>1842–43</strong>
              - She translates an article on Babbage's Analytical Engine including her own set of notes, which were three times as long as the original article, on the subject. In her notes she describes among other things a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine. This method is widely considered to be the first computer program and her work marks her as the first computer programmer.
